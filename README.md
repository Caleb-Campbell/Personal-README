    -GET TO KNOW ME-
    
Before we get to talking in person, I’d love for you to get to know me a bit better!
I’m an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for making applications and webpages for real people, real businesses, and real causes. Using my charisma and organization skills, I ensure that the work I do mirrors what the client wants. Give me a ‘what’ and ‘when’, and I will deliver what you need with integrity. 

    -ABOUT ME-
I have worked since I can remember, with my first unofficial job at the age of 14, working to maintain a large property. I was always eager to start a new job at the beginning of a new season because I love learning new skills and interacting with customers in new ways. Although none of the jobs were strictly technical, I learned valuable skills in team management, organization, and learned to get and maintain attention to detail. While considering many different career paths, one of the greatest satisfactions I receive in life comes after I complete a project, whatever it might be. While searching for what I wanted to do as a career, this fulfillment brought me to where I am now. I love building, maintaining, and optimizing each task I am given. I feel as though Web Development is perfect for me, and I am for it.

    -EDUCATION-
I chose to study for a time at BYU Idaho. After 3 semesters, I began to be frustrated with the pace I was going at. I loved learning about Python, SQL, and other technical skills, but they all felt very isolated from one another. I desperately wanted to learn how to build real-world applications, but that was years down the road. For now, I had to take classes like Meat Sciences 101 to fulfill my credits. So I began researching on my own, taking classes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my yearning for more, I found BloomTech, and after completing the trial run, I knew it was perfect for me. BloomTech taught me the technical skills I needed to create things I had been dreaming about. Each concept and skill I learned was exhilarating. It helped me begin to create some of the personal and freelance applications I am so proud of.

    -TECHNICAL SKILLS-
HTML/JSX
CSS (react-components, framer-motion, swiperJS)
React (React Router, State Management)
NodeJS (Express, knexJS, JSwebTokens, BcryptJS)
Testing (Cypress, component-testing)
